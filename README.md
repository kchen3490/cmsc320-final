# CMSC 320 Final Project

**Authors:** Kai C, Nathaniel G, Josiah L, Joseph T

**Data Set:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday2/heart-attack-prediction-in-united-states

**Why:** 
We chose this particular data set because it has 372,974 observations and 32 columns, so there is a significant amount of sample data. Additionally, we believe this data set will provide sufficient data for finding correlations between the many columns, such as demographics and health data points like cholesterol levels to check if someone had a heart attack or not. Additionally, we have a sufficient amount of data from this data set to provide hypothesis testing, data preprocessing, machine learning analysis, visualization, insights and conclusions in order to predict how and why people have heart attacks.
